As we Cloud Solution Architects(CSA's) know that most of the services, components and constructs are common across the Hyperscalers, each have their own terminologies and also some variations in technologies. I have learnt from my experience that when we work on a cloud engagement, mainly focused on one cloud provider, we learn and gain deeper knowledge on that specific cloud provider terminologies and technologies. And switch to another cloud provider for another engagement, learn, gain knowledge..... and in this process get a memory loss on what was learnt earlier from & about the other cloud provider - end up googling !! Hence started capturing this for my own benefit, and thought the cloud community can benefit too.
