I have learnt from my experience that when we work on one cloud engagement, mainly focused on one cloud provider, we learn and gain deeper knowledge on that specific cloud provider terminologies and technologies. And switch to another cloud provider for another engagement, learn, gain knowledge..... and in this process get a memory loss on what was learnt earlier from & about the other cloud provider - end up googling !! Hence started capturing this as reference for my own benefit, and thought the cloud community can benefit too. As I learn new things each day, I plan to keep adding to this list...!
