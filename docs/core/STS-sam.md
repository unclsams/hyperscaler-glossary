# STS Announcement

STS Parents & Students, Sangamam Tamil School (STS) announces its **RETURN to IN-PERSON CLASSES FROM JAN 8th 2022** !!

Location: Mercer Middle School, Aldie. 
Timing: 10:30 am to 12:15pm

STS will follow covid-19 protocols prescribed by Loudoun County which mandates wearing masks at **ALL TIMES** by Teachers, Students, Volunteers, parents/guardians and anyone accompanying the student.

If at any time during the school year, any student, parent or family member is infected with Covid-19 or comes in close proximity to someone who is infected, LCPS protocol should be followed: (**This below content, marked in blue, will be moved to STS website**)  

<span style="color:blue"> "Students and staff that are identified as close contacts of someone diagnosed with COVID-19 may return to school after 7 days if they provide a negative COVID-19 test performed on or after day 5 following exposure and do not have any symptoms. Those who can provide documentation of having COVID-19 in the past three months or have been fully vaccinated for COVID-19 are not required to quarantine as long as they do not have symptoms. Close contacts should still monitor for symptoms through day 14 and seek testing immediately if they develop any symptoms. Day 0 is the last day of exposure to the person with COVID-19. Antigen, PCR, or verifiable, proctored home tests are all acceptable.  
If a student or staff member lives with someone with COVID-19 and is not fully vaccinated or recently recovered, they should begin quarantine after the last sick member of their household ends their 10 day isolation. 
If household members are able to be completely separate from the sick person, they should begin quarantine after their last contact with the sick person. Complete separation means having no contact, spending no time together in shared spaces, staying in a separate bedroom, and using a separate bathroom."
