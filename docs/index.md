## Welcome to Azure Solution Architecture Guidance


This **Azure Solution Guidance** describes the approach for guiding Kyndryl's clients in their cloud adoption journey.

The purpose of this guidance is to provide a comprehensive approach, from understanding and defining client needs, to design a solution which addresses the client needs for cloud adoption, as well as lay the foundation for client's cloud expansion.

This guidance is in alignment with [Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/overview) and [Kyndryl's Cloud Architecture Design (CAD)](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cloud-architecture-design), and is applicable across client engagements.

## Target Audience

This document provides a framework for Kyndryl's **Solution Architects** to develop solution design for Kyndryl's clients on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.  
 
## Re-Use of existing Solutions
This guidance re-uses existing Kyndryl solutions and assets wherever possible. As an example, this guidance will point to Kyndryl's [CMM](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cloudmigrationfactory-offerings/capabilities-enablement/target-platforms-guides-handbooks) for migration to Azure cloud.
