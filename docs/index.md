#Introduction

Hello All, Im a Cloud Solution Architect(CSA) working on major public clouds, **aka Hypervisors**, for more than year. 

As we Cloud Solution Architects(CSA's) know that most of the services, components and constructs are common across the Hyperscalers, each have their own terminologies and also some variations in technologies.

I have learnt from my experience that when we work on one cloud engagement, mainly focused on one cloud provider, we learn and gain deeper knowledge on that specific cloud provider terminologies and technologies. And switch to another cloud provider for another engagement, learn, gain knowledge..... and in this process get a memory loss on what was learnt earlier from & about the other cloud provider - end up googling !!

Hence started capturing this as reference for my own benefit, and thought the cloud community can benefit too.

As I learn new things each day, I plan to keep adding to this list...!

Feel Free to contribute !!
