# Strategy & Plan Overview

Purpose of this section is to guide cloud solution architects and cloud practitioners to define a **cloud adoption strategy & plan** for Kyndryl’s clients.

Guidance in this document is based on [Kyndryl's Cloud Technology Strategy Roadmap](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cloud-architecture-design/offerings/cloud-tech-strat-roadmap) and Microsoft's [Cloud Adoption Strategy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/). CAF is a full lifecycle framework, supporting customers throughout each phase of adoption. As shown in the diagram below, it consists of the Strategy, Plan, Readiness, Adopt, Govern and Manage phases. This section covers the Strategy and Plan phases. The other phases (sans Adopt) are covered in the Landing Zone design section.

## Expected Outcome from Solution Architects

Solution Architects will use this guidance to create a Strategy & Plan artifact for each client, in the format provided in the [Strategy & Plan template](https://ibm.box.com/s/g82a595tk2k8oj73udsuv85w4nlsz00r).

Follow the steps in this section to **populate** the above **template**.

This is required for **auditing purposes**, and a compliancy requirement from Microsoft as part of **MSP (Managed Service Provider) responsibilities**.



## Cloud Adoption Fundamentals - Pre-Requisite Learning

In order to define the right cloud adoption strategy in Microsoft Azure, cloud solution Architects should be familiar and have an understanding of cloud fundamentals. 

Below is a filtered list of topics from Microsoft’s CAF and the reader is expected to be through with these key cloud fundamentals. Though these are specific to Azure, some of the contents are generic enough to be applied and adopted for any cloud.

1. Choose the cloud adoption scenario that best supports your strategy
    * [Hybrid & Multi-Cloud Adoption](https:/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/hybrid/scenario-overview``)
    * [Unified Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/hybrid/unified-operations)
2.	Examine [antipatterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/antipatterns/antipatterns-to-avoid) across methodologies and their solutions
3.	Adopt the cloud to [deliver business and technical outcomes sooner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/#accelerate-adoption)
