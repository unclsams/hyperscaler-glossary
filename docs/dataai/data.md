## Messaging & Integrations

| Description| ??s | **Azure Event Grid** is a fully-managed event routing service running on top of Azure Service Fabric, is an eventing backplane that enables event-driven, reactive programming, uses the publish-subscribe model. Publishers emit events, but have no expectation about how the events are handled. Subscribers decide on which events they want to handle.Event Grid distributes events from different sources, such as Azure Blob storage accounts or Azure Media Services, to different handlers, such as Azure Functions or Webhooks. Event Grid was created to make it easier to build event-based and serverless applications on Azure. **Azure Event Hubs** is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. It can receive and process millions of events per second. It facilitates the capture, retention, and replay of telemetry and event stream data. The data can come from many concurrent sources. Event Hubs allows telemetry and event data to be made available to various stream-processing infrastructures and analytics services. **Azure Service Bus** is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics. The service is intended for enterprise applications that require transactions, ordering, duplicate detection, and instantaneous consistency. These services can be [used together](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services#use-the-services-together)
