# Design Approach

The approach consists of addressing the critical design areas outlined in the [Design document](https://pages.github.kyndryl.net/OCTO/azure/lzdesign/lzdesignapproach/), one after the other. Design considerations and recommendations are considered against the requirements that are either stated in the [Workload description](./wldescription.md) or assumed where needed. The outcome are design decisions that then drive the solution design.   

Practically, the approach may be more iterative to address the possible inter-dependencies between these areas.
